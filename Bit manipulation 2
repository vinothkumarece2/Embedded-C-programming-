We can also clear multiple bits by creating a mask with multiple bits set to 0. ANDing the number with this mask will clear all corresponding bits.
Example: Clearing the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Bits.


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{

    int num = 103;
    int mask;
    mask = ~(1<<1) | (1<<3) | (1<<4);
    num = num & mask;
    printf("the Op is %d\n",num);

}
