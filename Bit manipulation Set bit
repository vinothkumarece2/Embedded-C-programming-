Setting a bit means setting its value to 1. In C, we can set a given bit using the OR operator (|) combined with a bit mask.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{

   unsigned int num = 108;
   unsigned int mask;
    mask = (1<<5);
    num = num | mask;
    printf("the modified number is %u",num);
}

op is 108
