Clearing a Specific Bit in C
To clear a specific bit in a number, you can use a bit mask with the AND operator. In that bitmask number, only the bit you want to clear is set to 0, and all other bits are set to 1.
input:
binary_number: 01100111
bit to clear: 5th
Output:
binary_number: 01100111
mask_used: 11011111
We can use the left shift operator with NOT operator to create a mask but remember the 0-based indexing in the shifting.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int num = 103;
    int pos;
    int mask;
    mask=(num&~(1<<5));
    num = num & mask;
    printf("the clear bit is %d",num);
}
  OP the clear bit 5 position  after OP is 71
